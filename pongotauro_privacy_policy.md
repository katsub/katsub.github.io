## Pongotauro: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Pongotauro app for Android!

This is an Android game developed by katsub. The app is available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. The only thing stored is your saved game, locally on your device, and on the google cloud, if you choose to signup.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send an email to katsub.dev@gmail.com, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
katsub
